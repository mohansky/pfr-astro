  intro:
    - It all started with one light bulb moment- “What if we could fight invasive species by feeding them to our pets? Boom! Eco-friendly, tail wagging, purring, brilliance. 
    - With over a decade of experience working on river ecosystems, we saw an opportunity to flip the script- turning an environmental challenge into a sustainable, nutritious solution to fulfill your pets needs and reduce your environmental pawprint.

  whythispetfoodTitle: Why this pet food
  whythispetfoodText:
    - Our meals and treats act as a supplement to meat based proteins and a replacement to ocean fish.
    - Skin irritation and inflammation in pets can often be caused by a surplus of omega 6 fatty acids in the body, which are commonly found in vegetable oils and chicken fat-
    - Omega 3 found naturally in fish can counteract the effects of omega 6.
