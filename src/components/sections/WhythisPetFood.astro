          Skin irritation and inflammation in pets can often be caused by a
          surplus of omega 6 fatty acids in the body, which are commonly found
          in vegetable oils and chicken fat-

      <!-- We aim to provide wholesome treats and supplements to take care of
          your petsâ€™ nutritional requirements, with the additional benefits of
          addressing joint and skin health. We provide sustainable fish based
          pet food, through the use of overpopulated invasive freshwater fishes
          as a source of fish protein in pet food. It also provides an
          alternative source to wild caught/ farmed marine fish, with its high
          nutritional value and omega 3 fatty acids. Every purchase you make
          contributes towards river research and conservation projects. -->
